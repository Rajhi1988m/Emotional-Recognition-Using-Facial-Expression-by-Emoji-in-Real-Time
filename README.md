1. About this research thesis: 

This research thesis investigates emotional recognition using facial expression by emoji in real time. Moreover, it also develops the parameters of measuring the facial expression and understanding the facial emotion recognition in real time. The application developed includes six human expressions, which include neutral, fear, anger, happy, sad, and surprise emotions. These expressions are the actual expressions which are being conveyed in human beings. The investigations of such expression are important because of their ability to better express human emotions and the way they facilitate communications among the people. Recommendations on further research will be provided for researchers.

2. Motivation: 

Communication is an important part of everyday life. Verbal or non-verbal communication allows one to engage in conversations. Today is the era of communication technologies. The internet and other communication devices have made it possible to engage in the fast, dynamic, and affective communication. The emojis are being used for the visual depictions of human emotions. Therefore, the present study in that realm focuses on the use of the emojis as an important technique that can be used in the field. Hence, the present research will be designed to assess human emotions and their visual depiction in the form of six emotions. These emotions include neutral, fear, anger, happy, sad, and surprise emotions. These are important human expressions and, thus, are quite important. The channels show the convolution of 3D delineation models. These models are prone to the use of layers, which records clamor in process. Moreover, these applications will be developed in the study to assess its impacts on the emojis.
