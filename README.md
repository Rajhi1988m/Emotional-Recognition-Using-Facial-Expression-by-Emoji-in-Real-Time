About the thesis: 

This research thesis investigates emotional recognition using facial expression by emoji in real time. Moreover, it also develops the parameters of measuring the facial expression and understanding the facial emotion recognition in real time. The application developed includes six human expressions, which include neutral, fear, anger, happy, sad, and surprise emotions. These expressions are the actual expressions which are being conveyed in human beings. The investigations of such expression are important because of their ability to better express human emotions and the way they facilitate communications among the people. Recommendations on further research will be provided for researchers.
