        <h1>Emotional Recognition</h1>
        <p>Communication is an important part of everyday life. Verbal or non-verbal communication allows one to engage in conversations. Today is the era of communication technologies. The internet and other communication devices have made it possible to engage in the fast, dynamic, and affective communication. The emojis are being used for the visual depictions of human emotions. </p>

          <h3>The Project</h3>
          <!-- a paragraph talks about my thesis -->
          <p>This project presents my research thesis investigates emotional recognition using a facial expression by emoji in real time. Moreover, it also develops the parameters of measuring the facial expression and understanding the facial emotion recognition in real time. The application developed includes six human expressions, which include neutral, fear, anger, happy, sad, and surprise emotions. These expressions are the actual expressions which are being conveyed in human beings. The investigations of such expression are important because of their ability to better express human emotions and the way they facilitate communications among the people. Recommendations on further research will be provided for researchers.</p>

        <!-- a paragraph talks about my universtiy -->
          <p>IÂ would like to show my special thanks and gratitude to my most respected thesis advisor and an assistant professor, Dr. Jens Hannemann of the Division of Computer Science at Kentucky State University. Dr. Hannemann gave me the opportunity to conduct the research on the following topic. This research work provided me lot of opportunities to learn new knowledge, and it also helped me to improve my writing skills. In the course of my research work, a lot of work has been done and I came to know about so many new things in my life. This is important, and I am very thankful to him. Secondly, it is an honor for me too to thank my parents and friends. Their emotional and psychological support also helped to learn and to complete the project. </p>

          <!-- a paragraph talks about the Affectiva SDK -->
          <p>Affectiva is an emotion determination technology company that grew out of MIT's Media Lab which develops a method for computers to recognize human emotions based on facial cues or physiological acknowledgments. Utilizing Affectiva SDK and API, developers can emotion-enable their apps, devices and digital experiences, so these can sense and adapt to human emotions. Furthermore, the technology enables a person's heart rate to be measured from a webcam without the person wearing anything. Available for all major platforms, on a device and in the cloud. Amidst facial coding and emotion analytics advertisers can measure unfiltered and unbiased consumer emotional responses to digital content. </p>
